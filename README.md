# 👋 Hello, I'm Sharat

I'm an Industrial Automation Engineer with over 10 years of experience, currently expanding my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through a master’s program. My journey combines a robust background in industrial automation with a new focus on the ethical and responsible development of AI.

### 👨‍💻 Expertise & Skills

 - Industrial Automation: PLC, SCADA, IEC61131-3, IEC61499 programming
 - Current Focus: AI/ML applications, Responsible AI, AI Ethics

### 🌱 Exploring

I’m delving deeper into AI/ML and interested in responsible AI and AI ethics, particularly as they relate to industrial automation and beyond.

### When I’m not working on projects or studying, I’m often:

  - Reading and Watching Science Fiction: I love exploring speculative worlds that push the boundaries of science and technology.
  - Science Communication: I enjoy sharing insights from science and technology with a broader audience. Find my blog here - https://medium.com/@Fuzz45
  - Learning: I’m a lifelong learner with an insatiable curiosity for new knowledge
